# Terminal Elevator Simulator
This project aims to create a ncurse program similar to steam locomotive (sl) that
shows an elevator going up and down and transporting people from floor to floor.


# Simulating an elevator
While an Elevator might seem simple at a first glance, an elevator has to move from floor
to floor following a set of rules depending which button was pressed by the elevator's
users.

## Simulation Actors
### Meditator
The mediator class of this project is used to organize every actors and let them interact
together on each tick of the simulation.

### Elevator
The elevator is the main entity of this simulation, it has to act 


#### Rules

### User
Users are spawned on a random floor and are also given a random floor they want to access.
They'll make their way to the elevator and push the up or down button depending on which
floor they want to access.

#### Rules

### Floor
I debated on wether the floors should be an entity as they contain the buttons and the users

#### Rules
